# DPA: Dual Prototypes Alignment for Unsupervised Adaptation of Vision-Language Models

This is the PyTorch code of the [DPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08855) paper.

## Dataset Setup

Dataset paths are stored in [dataset_catalog.json](https://github.com/Externalhappy/DPA/blob/main/json_files/dataset_catalog.json), which need to be modified to local paths. Please refer to the scripts from [VISSL](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vissl/tree/main/extra_scripts/datasets) to download and prepare the datasets. The dataset labels are stored in [classes.json](https://github.com/Externalhappy/DPA/blob/main/json_files/classes.json).

## Requirements

- PyTorch 1.10.0 or later
- timm 0.4.12
- tensorboardX
- ftfy

## Training

Run the following command:

```bash
python train.py --dataset [name_of_dataset]
```
